# Calendar fun

Build my own custom calendar.

Supports user specfic configurations such as:

- Timerange (e.g. 7-22 or 8-24),
- Validation callback functions (e.g. should not allow to overlap other events)
- isEventReadOnly callback function (e.g. cannot move/edit or click certain events)

This is a work in progress as I have dozens of features in the pipeline.
